In the Rasio 8.0 Data Science Competition at Universitas Padjadjaran, my team and I developed a data analysis model to assess Indonesia's economic conditions using datasets from the Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS). My responsibilities included data analysis, data cleaning, and model development, ensuring that the processed data provided meaningful insights for economic evaluation. Through this project, we applied machine learning techniques and statistical methods to uncover trends and patterns that could support better economic decision-making.

Key Features:
- Matplotlib for Visualization – Used to create insightful graphs and charts to represent economic trends clearly.
- Regression for Prediction – Implemented regression models to forecast economic indicators and trends.
- Critical Thinking – Applied analytical reasoning to interpret data patterns and refine the model for better accuracy.
